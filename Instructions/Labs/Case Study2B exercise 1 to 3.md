    US-009. 

-   Rebates are given to the customer when they purchase a specific product. In
    this case, the product has item number T0020. 

-   The customer's sales performance, against which the rebate amounts are
    estimated, is to be accumulated on a weekly basis.  

    -   The setting for **Price taken from** is **Gross**, which means that
        line's sales amount on which basis the claim is estimated is not reduced
        by the line discount. 

    -   The **Rebate line break type** field shows the method for calculating
        rebates. In this case, the sales target against which the rebates are to
        be estimated is set to Quantity. 

    -   The agreement's lines specify the rebate amount type, the actual rebate
        value, and the thresholds. In this example, the customer will qualify
        for a rebate of 20 USD per unit sold, if their weekly purchases of the
        product fall within 1 to 50 units; and a rebate of 40 USD per unit sold,

    may be different depending on: the total sales volume achieved by the
    customer under a periodic rebate agreement; whether the customer had
    returned all or partial quantities; and whether the applicable sales order
    was invoiced.

agreement USMF-000001. 

 

The line represents a rebate claim for 800 USD, which is based on the sales of
40 units of product T0020, calculated at 20 USD per unit. This matches the
conditions of the first quantity break in the rebate agreement.

    incurred in connection with the sales. 

 

### Process rebates for payment

rebate workbench and that are in status **Mark**. When you create a credit note,
a message appears to inform you that a journal has been posted.
